# TransE
TransE is an energy-based model that produces knowledge base embeddings. It models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Relationships are represented as translations in the embedding space: if  holds, the embedding of the tail entity  should be close to the embedding of the head entity  plus some vector that depends on the relationship .
